# Update....it finally worked as i was testing it again.  not entirely sure why it wasn't before.


# This is the error I keep running into.  the code works, but i cannot get the shell script to work.
# i've tried multiple things that i googled to make it work, still cannot get it to work.  
# First I get this error:
# krist@Kristy MINGW64 ~/OneDrive/Data Analyst class work/bash_scripts_2
# $ boot.sh
# bash: boot.sh: command not found
# 
# So I try to use bash boot.sh.  I get this:


# The script is fully executable.
# krist@Kristy MINGW64 ~/OneDrive/Data Analyst class work/bash_scripts_2
# $ ls -all boot.sh
# -rwxr-xr-x 1 krist 197609 464 Mar 11 21:04 boot.sh*
